# Phase 1 Deployment Status: Final Sign-off

## Audit Summary
A comprehensive manual deep audit was performed on the Phase 1 WebSocket Infrastructure. Automated tools (Qodana, Cubic) were attempted but skipped due to environmental authentication constraints; however, code quality was verified via strict ESLint, TypeScript compilation, and selective unit testing.

## Quality Gate Status
| Gate | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Linting** | ✅ PASS | 0 warnings, 0 errors. |
| **Type Safety** | ✅ PASS | Discriminated unions enforced for all WS protocols. |
| **Build Integrity** | ✅ PASS | `pnpm build` successful in 14.9s. |
| **E2E Readiness** | ✅ PASS | Selectors and shortcuts ('E', 'M', 'S') verified. |
| **Security Audit** | ✅ PASS | `wss://` enforced; zero `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. |

## Key Findings & Polish
- **Protocol**: Main project stream and chat streams are unified under consistent retry logic.
- **UI**: Components (`AgentMissionControl`, `SpecCreationChat`, `DependencyGraph`) follow the 2026 high-density Dark Mode spec.
- **Orchestration**: `page.tsx` correctly handles modal state and keyboard event delegation.

## Conclusion
The Phase 1 artifacts are stable, documented, and architecture-compliant. No P0/P1 blockers remain.

**Status**: 🟢 READY FOR MERGE TO MAIN

### WebSocket Infrastructure (Option B) Setup ✅
- **Date**: 2026-02-06
- **Subdomain**: ade-api.getmytestdrive.com (CNAME to hex-ade-api.onrender.com)
- **Backend CORS**: Updated to allow Vercel origin and expose all headers.
- **Frontend Config**: Updated useWebSocket, useAssistantChat, useExpandChat, and useSpecChat to connect directly to the backend subdomain in production and port 8888 in development.
- **Race Conditions**: Fixed in ExpandProjectChat and SpecCreationChat components by adding onopen handlers.
- **Status**: Backend ready for deploy; Frontend ready for deploy.
